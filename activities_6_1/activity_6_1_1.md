# 6.01 Activity 1 

- using a pen and paper, sketch an ERD diagram of the tables in the excel workbook Bookshop to identify the expected relationships, keys(primary, foreign) and cardinality 
- as seen in the lesson, get this data source into PowerBI and add the tables: Author, Award, Book, Checkout, Edition, Publisher Ratings
- ensure the tables are joined in the Model view - apply any needed transformations as seen in the lesson 
- also in the Model view, rearrange the tables to make the ERD easier to read - suggestion, the diagram should resemble a star schema as closely as possible 
- remaining in the Model view, hide any repeated fields (ids) from the report view 
- go into report view to review and validate the model you have assembled
