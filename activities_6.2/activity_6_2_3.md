# 6_2 Activity 3

As you saw in the latest lesson, using a DAX approach can save time and logically will help you keep your powerbi workbooks small by not creating extra denormalised tables/queries. 

In this activity you are asked to spend some time reviewing the DAX documentation shared in the last lesson, or watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUaEdwN9J1I) if you find that explains these concepts better, in order to resolve activities 1 and 2 of this lesson using a DAX formula. 

Perhaps you find the DAX LOOKUP works well or you may find a better DAX solution. 

Be prepared after the activity to share your DAX method and any other useful DAX formulae you have discovered during your exploration.
