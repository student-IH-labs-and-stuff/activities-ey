# 6.02 Activity 2 

For this activity continue with the scenario from activity 1 - whether you followed the merge query approach or another method in PowerBI:

1) create a single column for first name, surname as **author name** (hint concatenate twice in a calculation or use a transformation step in the query) 
2) create a table which summarises per author name, the number of reviews and the total checkouts that author has over their collection of published books 
3) create a scatter plot to represent this data but with the addition of average review rating on the opposite axis and Genre on the colour legend
4) spend some time examining the chart to identify any trends patterns or outliers by genre 
5) optional - apply some formatting changes to make the chart more readable or add a filter (example : to filter by publishing house/ country) in case this reveals more insights that could be shared with the class
